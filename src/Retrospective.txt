- Kwitter Retrospective Notes -

Coming into this project initially felt like a huge leap from anything
that I was capable of at this current stage as a junior developer.
To be honest in a lot of ways it still feels pretty foreign and with
a lot of moving parts that I only understand so much.
I would have liked to have been able to break down the building of
Kwitter into a series of group assessments that built off of one another
and eventually led into what the final submission of the project would
be. Of course that would have required a lot of reworking on the back end,
but I know I personally would have felt far more confident both going 
in and coming out of the other side. All in all it's been interesting
to say the least.
