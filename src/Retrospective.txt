- Kwitter Retrospective Notes -

Coming into this project initially felt like a huge leap from anything
that I was capable of at this current stage as a junior developer.
To be honest in a lot of ways it still feels pretty foreign and with
a lot of moving parts that I only understand so much.
I would have liked to have been able to break down the building of
Kwitter into a series of group assessments that built off of one another
and eventually led into what the final submission of the project would
be. Of course that would have required a lot of reworking on the back end,
but I know I personally would have felt far more confident both going 
in and coming out of the other side. All in all it's been interesting
to say the least.

Thoughts by Meagan:

If I had a do-over, I would somehow understand Todo Part 3 better. That way I would've been able to spend more time on Kwitter. Our group had 4 days to complete Kwitter, start to finish. The thing I wanted to work on more was CSS/UX/UI. Our app was very funcitonal but not very attractive. I wish we had done more styling.
